# Contributing to ABAP Logger

Welcome & thanks for taking your time to contribute to the project.


## Rules
Some rules we've agreed on:
  * code must be compatible with 7.02 ABAP
  * new functionalities must be covered with unit tests
  * all unit test must pass
  * Style is KEYWORD uppercase; non-keyword lowercase (cf. @mbtools's ABAPgit User exit to pretty-print accordingly automatically : https://gist.github.com/mbtools/71aa345a8ccb8f375568f9f337569154)

## Recommandations
  * We appreciate [Clean Code](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md#avoid-encodings-esp-hungarian-notation-and-prefixes)'s recommandations and we'd like to enforce theses rules. Yet, most of the code has been written previously and we take care not to break compatibility.
  * Don't hesitate to open an issue before submitting something substantial
